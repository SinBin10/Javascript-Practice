Here are the learnings from the projects I make

1) A div can also be centered by the following code :-
    width: 80%;
    margin: 1rem auto;
Here the left and right margin are automatically adjusted by the browser.

2) box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px;
here the first two properties represent x and y axis the third one represents blur effect and the 4th one represents spread.

3) An array in js is represented by const arr = [{key: value,
                                                  key: value }];
You can change its value by
arr[index].key;
